# rosalia: Exact inference for small binary Markov networks

Santa Rosalia, the patron saint of biodiversity, became a symbol in the 1970's
and 1980's for ecologists that wanted to use species co-occurrence data to 
draw inferences about how those species interacted with one another.
This package, which provides tools from statistical physics for drawing such
inference, is named in her honor.
