rosalia: Exact inference for small binary Markov networks
=========================================================

Santa Rosalia, the patron saint of biodiversity, became a controversial symbol in the 1970's and 1980's for ecological inferences regarding species' interactions. This package, which provides tools from statistical physics for drawing such inferences, is named in her honor.

Installation:
=============

The easiest way to install `rosalia` is with the `devtools` package, which can be installed from the R command line with `install.packages("devtools")`.

Once `devtools` is available, `rosalia` can be downloaded and installed with `devtools::install_github("davharris/rosalia")`
