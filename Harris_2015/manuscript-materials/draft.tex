\textbf{Title:} Estimating species interactions from observational data
with Markov networks

\textbf{Author:} David J. Harris: Population Biology; 1 Shields Avenue,
Davis CA, 95616

\textbf{Abstract:} Estimating species interactions from observational
data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One
difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an
ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For
example, two competing species would ordinarily correlate negatively in
space, but this effect can be reversed in the presence of a third
species that is capable of outcompeting both of them when it is present.
Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or
Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect
consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in
these models can be estimated from observational data via maximum
likelihood. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction
strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and several existing approaches.
The Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly
isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect
interactions or abiotic environmental effects largely overpowered them.
Two computationally efficient approximations, based on linear and
generalized linear models, also performed well. Indirect effects
reliably caused a common null modeling approach to produce incorrect
inferences, however.

\subsubsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\setlength{\parindent}{1em} \setlength{\parskip}{3pt}

If nontrophic species interactions, such as competition, are important
drivers of community assembly, then ecologists might expect to see their
influence in species composition data (MacArthur 1958, Diamond 1975).
Despite decades of work and several major controversies, however (Lewin
1983, Strong et al. 1984, Gotelli and Entsminger 2003, Connor et al.
2013), existing methods for detecting competition's effects on community
structure are unreliable (Gotelli and Ulrich 2009). In particular,
species' effects on one another can become lost in the complex web of
direct and indirect interactions in real assemblages. For example, the
competitive interaction between the two shrub species in Figure 1A can
become obscured by their shared tendency to occur in unshaded areas
(Figure 1B). While ecologists have long known that indirect effects can
overwhelm direct ones at the landscape level (Dodson 1970, Levine 1976),
the vast majority of our methods for drawing inferenes from
observational data do not control for these effects (e.g. Diamond 1975,
Strong et al. 1984, Gotelli and Ulrich 2009, Veech 2013, Pollock et al.
2014). To the extent that indirect interactions like those in Figure 1
are generally important (Dodson 1970), existing methods will thus not
generally provide much evidence regarding species' direct effects on one
another. The goal of this paper is to resolve this long-standing
problem.

While competition doesn't reliably leave the expected pattern in
community structure (low co-occurrence rates at the landscape level), it
nevertheless does leave a signal in the data (Figure 1C). Specifically,
\emph{among shaded sites}, there will be a deficit of co-occurrences
between the competing shrub species, and \emph{among unshaded sites},
there will also be such a deficit. More generally, we can obtain much
better estimates of the association between two species from their
conditional relationships (i.e.~by controlling for other species in the
network) than we could get from their overall co-occurrence rates. This
kind of precision is difficult to obtain from null models, which begin
with the assumptions that all the pairwise interactions are zero and
thus don't need to be controlled for. Nevertheless, null models have
dominated this field for more than three decades (Strong et al. 1984,
Gotelli and Ulrich 2009).

Following recent work by Azaele et al. (2010) and Fort (2013), this
paper shows that Markov networks (undirected graphical models also known
as Markov random fields; Murphy 2012) can provide a framework for
understanding the landscape-level consequences of pairwise species
interactions, and for detecting them from observed presence-absence
matrices. Markov networks have been used in many scientific fields for
decades in similar contexts, from physics (where nearby particles
interact magnetically; Cipra 1987) to spatial statistics (where adjacent
grid cells have correlated values; Harris 1974, Gelfand et al. 2005).
While community ecologists explored some related approaches in the
1980's (Whittam and Siegel-Causey 1981), they used severe approximations
that led to unintelligible results (e.g. ``probabilities'' greater than
one; Gilpin and Diamond 1982).

Below, I introduce Markov networks and show how they can be used to
simulate landscape-level data or to make exact predictions about the
direct and indirect consequences of possible interaction matrices. Then,
using simulated data sets where the ``true'' interactions are known, I
compare this approach with several existing methods. Finally, I discuss
opportunities for extending the approach presented here to other
problems in community ecology, e.g.~quantifying the overall effect of
species interactions on occurrence rates (Roughgarden 1983) and
disentangling the effects of biotic versus abiotic interactions on
species composition (Kissling et al. 2012, Pollock et al. 2014).

\subsubsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\paragraph{Markov networks.}\label{markov-networks.}

Markov networks provide a framework for translating back and forth
between the conditional relationships among species (Figure 1C) and the
kinds of species assemblages that these relationships produce. Here, I
show how a set of conditional relationships can be used to determine the
how groups of species can co-occur. Methods for estimating conditional
relationships from data are discussed in the next section.

A Markov network defines the relative probability of observing a given
vector of species-level presences (1s) and absences (0s), \(\vec{y}\),
as

\centering

\(p(\vec{y}; \alpha, \beta) \propto exp(\sum_{i}\alpha_i y_i + \sum_{i\neq j}\beta_{ij}y_i y_j).\)

\raggedright
\setlength{\parindent}{1em}

Here, \(\alpha_{i}\) is an intercept term determining the amount that
the presence of species \(i\) contributes to the log-probability of
\(\vec{y}\); it directly controls the prevalence of species \(i\).
Similarly, \(\beta_{ij}\) is the amount that the co-occurrence of
species \(i\) and species \(j\) contributes to the log-probability; it
controls the conditional relationship between two species, i.e.~the
probability that they will be found together, after controlling for the
other species in the network (Figure 2A, Figure 2B). For example,
\(\beta_{ij}\) might have a value of \(+2\) for two mutualists,
indicating that the odds of observing one species are \(e^2\) times
higher in sites where its partner is present than in comparable sites
where its partner is absent. Because the relative probability of a
presence-absence vector increases when positively-associated species
co-occur and decreases when negatively-associated species co-occur, the
model tends---all else equal---to produce assemblages that have many
pairs of positively-associated species and relatively few pairs of
negatively-associated species (exactly as an ecologist might expect).

Of course, if all else is \emph{not} equal (e.g.~Figure 1, where the
presence of one competitor is associated with release from another
competitor), then species' marginal association rates can differ from
this expectation. Determining the marginal relationships between species
from their conditional interactions entails summing over the different
possible assemblages (Figure 2B). This becomes intractable when the
number of possible assemblages is large, though several methods beyond
the scope of this paper can be employed to keep the calculations
feasible (Salakhutdinov 2008, Lee and Hastie 2012). Alternatively, as
noted below, some common linear and generalized linear methods can also
be used as computationally efficient approximations to the full network
(Lee and Hastie 2012, Loh and Wainwright 2013).

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Estimating \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)
coefficients from presence-absence
data.}{Estimating \textbackslash{}alpha and \textbackslash{}beta coefficients from presence-absence data.}}\label{estimating-alpha-and-beta-coefficients-from-presence-absence-data.}

In the previous section, the values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) were
known and the goal was to make predictions about possible species
assemblages. In practice, however, ecologists will often need to
estimate the parameters from an observed co-occurrence matrix (i.e.~from
a matrix of ones and zeros indicating which species are present at which
sites). When the number of species is reasonably small, one can compute
exact maximum likelihood estimates for all of the \(\alpha\) and
\(\beta\) coefficients given a presence-absence matrix by optimizing
\(p(\vec{y}; \alpha, \beta)\). Fully-observed Markov networks like the
ones considered here have unimodal likelihood surfaces (Murphy 2012),
ensuring that this procedure will always converge on the global maximum.
This maximum represents the unique combination of \(\alpha\) and
\(\beta\) coefficients that would be expected to produce exactly the
observed co-occurrence frequencies on average (i.e.~it matches the
sufficient statistics of the model distribution to the sufficient
statistics of the data; Murphy 2012). I used the rosalia package (Harris
2015a) for the R programming language (R Core Team 2015) to optimize the
Markov network parameters. The package was named after Santa Rosalia,
the patron saint of biodiversity, whose supposedly miraculous healing
powers played an important rhetorical role in the null model debates of
the 1970's and 1980's (Lewin 1983).

\paragraph{Simulated landscapes.}\label{simulated-landscapes.}

In order to compare different methods, I simulated two sets of
landscapes using known parameters. The first set included the three
competing species shown in Figure 1. For each of 1000 replicates, I
generated a landscape with 100 sites by sampling from a probability
distribution defined by the figure's interaction coefficients (Appendix
1). Each of the methods described below was then evaluated on its
ability to correctly infer that the two shrub species competed with one
another, despite their frequent co-occurrence.

I also simulated a second set of landscapes using a stochastic community
model based on generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics, as described in
Appendix 2. In these simulations, each species pair was randomly
assigned to either compete for a portion of the available carrying
capacity (negative interaction) or to act as mutualists (positive
interaction). Here, mutualisms operate by mitigating the effects of
intraspecific competition on each partner's death rate. For these
analyses, I simulated landscapes with up to 20 species and 25, 200, or
1600 sites (50 replicates per landscape size; see Appendix 2).

\paragraph{Recovering species interactions from simulated
data.}\label{recovering-species-interactions-from-simulated-data.}

I compared seven techniques for determining the sign and strength of the
associations between pairs of species from simulated data (Appendix 3).

First, I used the rosalia package (Harris 2015a) to fit Markov newtork
models, as described above. For the analyses with 20 species, I added a
very weak logistic prior distribution on the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)
terms with scale 2 to ensure that the model estimates were always
finite. The bias introduced by this prior should be small: the 95\%
credible interval on \(\beta\) only requires that one species' effect on
the odds of observing a different species to be less than a factor of
1500 (which is not much of a constraint). The logistic distribution was
chosen because it is convex and has a similar shape to the Laplace
distribution used in LASSO regularization (especially in the tails), but
unlike the Laplace distribution it is differentiable everywhere and does
not force any estimates to be exactly zero. To confirm that this
procedure produced stable estimates, I compared its estimates on 50
bootstrap replicates (Appendix 4).

I also evaluated five alternative methods from the existing literature
(plus a novel variant of the fifth method). The first two alternative
interaction measures were the sample correlations and the partial
correlations between each pair of species' data vectors on the landscape
(Albrecht and Gotelli 2001, Faisal et al. 2010). In the context of
non-Gaussian data, the partial correlation can be thought of as a
computationally efficient approximation to the full Markov network model
(Loh and Wainwright 2013). This sort of model is very common for
estimating relationships among genes and gene products (Friedman et al.
2008). Because partial correlations are undefined for landscapes with
perfectly-correlated species pairs, I used a regularized estimate based
on James-Stein shrinkage, as implemented in the corpcor package's
\texttt{pcor.shrink} function with the default settings (Schäfer et al.
2014).

The third alternative, generalized linear models (GLMs), can also be
thought of as a computationally efficient approximation to the Markov
network (Lee and Hastie 2012). Following Faisal et al. (2010), I fit
regularized logistic regression models (Gelman et al. 2008) for each
species, using the other species on the landscape as predictors. To
avoid the identifiability problems associated with directed cyclic
graphs (Schmidt and Murphy 2012), I then symmetrized the relationships
within species pairs via averaging.

The fourth alternative method, described in Gotelli and Ulrich (2009),
involved simulating new landscapes from a null model that retains the
row and column sums of the original matrix (Strong et al. 1984). I used
the \(Z\)-scores computed by the Pairs software described in Gotelli and
Ulrich (2009) as my null model-based estimator of species interactions.

The last two estimators used the latent correlation matrix estimated by
the BayesComm package (Golding and Harris 2015) in order to evaluate the
recent claim that the correlation coefficients estimated by ``joint
species distribution models'' provide an accurate assessment of species'
pairwise interactions (Pollock et al. 2014, see also Harris 2015b). In
addition to using the posterior mean correlation (Pollock et al. 2014),
I also used the posterior mean \emph{partial} correlation, which might
be able to control for indirect effects.

\paragraph{Evaluating model
performance.}\label{evaluating-model-performance.}

For the simulated landscapes based on Figure 1, I assessed whether each
method's test statistic indicated a positive or negative relationship
between the two shrubs (Appendix 1). For the null model (Pairs), I
calculated statistical significance using its \(Z\)-score. For the
Markov network, I used the Hessian matrix to generate approximate
confidence intervals and noted whether these intervals included zero.

I then evaluated the relationship between each method's estimates and
the ``true'' interaction strengths among all of the species pairs from
the larger simulated landscapes. This determined which the methods
provide a consistent way to know how strong species interactions
are---regardless of which species were present in a particular data set
or how many observations were taken. Because the different methods
mostly describe species interactions on different scales
(e.g.~correlations versus \(Z\) scores versus regression coefficients),
I used linear regression through the origin to rescale the different
estimates produced by each method so that they had a consistent
interpretation. After rescaling each method's estimates, I calculated
squared errors between the scaled interaction estimates and ``true''
interaction values across all the simulated data sets. These squared
errors determined the proportion of variance explained for different
combinations of method and landscape size (compared with a null model
that assumed all interaction strengths to be zero).

\subsubsection{Results}\label{results}

\paragraph{Three species.}\label{three-species.}

As shown in Figure 1, the marginal relationship between the two shrub
species was positive---despite their competition for space at a
mechanistic level---due to indirect effects of the dominant tree
species. As a result, the correlation between these species was positive
in 94\% of replicates, and the randomization-based null model falsely
reported positive associations 100\% of the time. Worse, more than 98\%
of these false conclusions were statistically significant. The partial
correlation and Markov network estimates, on the other hand, each
correctly isolated the direct negative interaction between the shrubs
from their positive indirect interaction 94\% of the time (although the
confidence intervals overlapped zero in most replicates).

\paragraph{Twenty species.}\label{twenty-species.}

Despite some variability across contexts (Figure 3A), the four methods
that controlled for indirect effects clearly performed the best: the
Markov network explained the largest portion of the variance in the
``true'' interaction coefficients (35\% overall), followed by the
generalized linear models (30\%), partial correlations from the raw
presence-absence data (28\%), and partial correlations from BayesComm,
the joint species distribution model (26\%). The benefit of choosing the
full Markov network over the other three methods was largest on the
smaller landscapes, which are also the ones that are most representative
of typical analyses in this field (Gotelli and Ulrich 2009).

The three methods that did not attempt to control for indirect
interactions all explained less than 20\% of the variance. Of these, the
sample correlation matrix based on the raw data performed the best
(19\%), followed by the null model (15\%) and BayesComm's correlation
matrix (11\%). Although these last three methods had different \(R^2\)
values, there was a close mapping among their estimates (especially
after controlling for the size of the simulated landscapes; Figure 3B).
This suggests that the effect sizes from the null model (and, to a
lesser extent, the correlation matrices from joint species distribution
models) only contain noisy versions of the same information that could
be obtained more easily and interpretably by calculating correlation
coefficients between species' presence-absence vectors.

Bootstrap resampling indicated that the above ranking of the different
methods was robust (Appendix 3). In particular, the 95\% confidence
interval of the bootstrap distribution indicated that the Markov
network's overall \(R^2\) value was between 14 and 18 percent higher
than the second-most effective method (generalized linear models) and
between 2.12 and 2.38 times higher than could be achieved by the null
model (Pairs). Bootstrap resampling of a 200-site landscape also
confirmed that the rosalia package's estimates of species' conditional
relationships were reasonably robust to sampling variation (Appendix 4).

\subsubsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The results presented above show that Markov networks can reliably
recover species' pairwise interactions from observational data, even for
cases where a common null modeling technique reliably fails.
Specifically, Markov networks were successful even when direct
interactions were largely overwhelmed by indirect effects (Figure 1).
For cases where fitting a Markov network is computationally infeasible,
these results also indicate that partial covariances and generalized
linear models (the two methods that estimated conditional relationships
rather than marginal ones) can both provide useful approximations. The
partial correlations' success on simulated data may not carry over to
real data sets, however; Loh and Wainwright (2013) show that the linear
approximations can be less reliable in cases where the true interaction
matrix contains more structure (e.g.~guilds or trophic levels).
Similarly, the approximation involved in using separate generalized
linear models for each species can occasionally lead to catastrophic
overfitting with small-to-moderate sample sizes (Lee and Hastie 2012).
For these reasons, it will usually be best to fit a Markov network
rather than one of the alternative methods when one's computational
resources allow it.

It's important to note that none of these methods can identify the exact
nature of the pairwise interactions (e.g.~which species in a
positively-associated pair is facilitating the other; Schmidt and Murphy
2012), particularly when real pairs of species can reciprocally
influence one another in multiple ways simultaneously (Bruno et al.
2003); with compositional data, there is only enough information to
provide a single number describing each species pair. To estimate
asymmetric interactions, such as commensalism or predation, ecologists
would need other kinds of data, as from time series, behavioral
observations, manipulative experiments, or natural history. These other
sources of information could also be used to augment the likelihood
function with an informative prior distribution, which could lead to
better results on some real data sets than was shown in Figure 3A.

Despite their limitations, Markov networks have enormous potential to
improve ecological understanding. In particular, they are less
vulnerable than some of the most commonly-used methods to mistakenly
identifying positive species interactions between competing species, and
can make precise statements about the conditions whre indirect
interactions will overwhelm direct ones. They also provide a simple
answer to the question of how competition should affect a species'
overall prevalence, which was a major flashpoint for the null model
debates in the 1980's (Roughgarden 1983, Strong et al. 1984). Equation 1
can be used to calculate the expected prevalence of a species in the
absence of biotic influences (\(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha}}\); Lee and
Hastie 2012). Competition's effect on prevalence in a Markov network can
then be calculated by subtracting this value from the observed
prevalence (cf Figure 2D). This kind of insight would have been
difficult to obtain without a generative model that makes predictions
about the consequences of species interactions; null models (which
presume \emph{a priori} that interactions do not exist) have no way to
make such predictions.

Markov networks---particularly the Ising model for binary
networks---have been studied in statistical physics for nearly a century
(Cipra 1987), and the models' properties, capabilities, and limits are
well-understood in a huge range of applications. Using the same
framework for species interactions would thus allow ecologists to tap
into an enormous set of existing discoveries and techniques for dealing
with indirect effects, stability, and alternative stable states.
Numerous other extensions are possible: for example, the states of the
interaction network can be modeled as a function of the local abiotic
environment (Lee and Hastie 2012), which would provide a rigorous and
straightforward approach to the difficult and important task of
incorporating whole networks of biotic interactions into species
distribution models (Kissling et al. 2012, Pollock et al. 2014), leading
to a better understanding of the interplay between biotic and abiotic
effects on community structure. There are even methods (Whittam and
Siegel-Causey 1981, Tjelmeland and Besag 1998) that would allow one
species to affect the sign or strength of the relationship between two
other species, tipping the balance between facilitation and exploitation
(Bruno et al. 2003).

Finally, the results presented here have important implications for
ecologists' continued use of null models for studying species
interactions. Null and neutral models can be useful for clarifying our
thinking about the numerical consequences of species' richness and
abundance patterns (Harris et al. 2011, Xiao et al. 2015), but
deviations from a particular null model must be interpreted with care
(Roughgarden 1983). Even in small networks with three species, it may
simply not be possible to implicate individual species pairs or specific
ecological processes like competition by rejecting a general-purpose
null (Gotelli and Ulrich 2009), especially when the test statistic is
effectively just a correlation coefficient (Figure 3B). Simultaneous
estimation of multiple ecological parameters seems like a much more
promising approach: to the extent that the models' relative performance
on real data sets is similar to the range of results shown in Figure 3A,
scientists in this field could often double their explanatory power by
switching from null models to Markov networks (or increase it
substantially by with linear or generalized linear approximations).
Regardless of the methods ecologists ultimately choose, controlling for
indirect effects could clearly improve our understanding of species'
direct effects on one another and on community structure.
