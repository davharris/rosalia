**Title: Estimating species interactions from observational data with Markov
networks**

***Abstract***

Inferring species interactions from observational data is one of the most
controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single
pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce
surprising indirect consequences. For example, two competing species would
ordinarily correlate negatively in space, but this effect can be reversed in
the presence of a third species that is capable of outcompeting both of them
when it is present. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called
Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and
indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions
in these models can be estimated from observational data via maximum
likelihood. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction
strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and several existing approaches. The
Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly isolating
direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or
abiotic environmental effects largely overpowered them. A linear
approximation, based on partial covariances, also performed well as long as
the number of sampled locations exceeded the number of species in the data.
Indirect effects reliably caused a common null modeling approach to produce
incorrect inferences, however.

***Introduction***

Ecologists' intense interest in drawing inferences about species interactions
---especially competition---from presence-absence data has a long history
[@macarthur_population_1958; @diamond_island_1975; @connor_checkered_2013]. If
nontrophic species interactions are important drivers of community assembly patterns,
then we should expect to see their influence in our data sets. Despite decades
of work and several major controversies, however [@lewin_santa_1983;
@strong_ecological_1984; @gotelli_swap_2003], existing methods for detecting
competition's effects on community structure are unreliable
[@gotelli_empirical_2009]. More generally, it can be difficult to reason about
the complex web of direct and indirect interactions that contribute to the
structure of real assemblages, especially when these interactions  occur
against a background of other ecological processes such as dispersal and
environmental filtering [@connor_checkered_2013]. For this reason, it isn't
always clear what kinds of patterns would even constitute evidence of
competition, as opposed to some other biological process or random sampling
error [@roughgarden_competition_1983; @lewin_santa_1983].

Most existing methods in this field compare the frequency with which two
putative competitors are observed to co-occur against the frequency that would
be expected if *all* species on the landscape were independent
[@strong_ecological_1984; @gotelli_empirical_2009]. Examining a species pair
against such a "null" background, however, rules out the possibility that the
overall association between two species could be driven by an outside force,
as shown in Figure 1. Even though the two shrub species in this example compete 
with one another for resources at a mechanistic level, they end up clustering
together on the landscape because they both grow best in areas that are not overshadowed
by trees. Due to fundamental constraints on the structure of valid
covariance matrices [@brown_constraints_2010], this kind of positive correlation
is almost inevitable, even when all the interactions are negative. For this
reason, knowing that the two shrubs co-occur more than expected by chance
under some null model (e.g. that their correlation in the data set is positive)
can not---by itself---tell us much about their direct effects on one another.

While the competition between the two shrubs in the previous example does not
leave the commonly-expected pattern in community structure (negative
association at the landscape level), it nevertheless does leave a signal in
the data (Figure 1C). Specifically, *among shaded sites*, there will be a
deficit of co-occurrences, and *among unshaded sites*, there will also be such
a deficit. These *conditional* ("all-else-equal") relationships can be estimated with partial
correlations [@albrecht_spatial_2001], although this approach is best-suited
for Gaussian variables.  For non-Gaussian data, a more general approach is
needed.

In this paper, I introduce Markov networks [undirected graphical models
also known as Markov random fields; @murphy_machine_2012] as a framework for
understanding the landscape-level consequences of pairwise species
interactions, and for detecting them from observational data. Markov networks,
which generalize partial correlations to non-Gaussian data, have been used in
many scientific fields to model associations between various kinds of
"particles". For example, a well-studied network called the Ising model has played
an important role in our understanding of physics [where nearby particles tend
to align magnetically with one another; @cipra_introduction_1987]. In spatial
contexts, these models have been used to describe interactions between
adjacent grid cells [@harris_contact_1974; @gelfand_modelling_2005]. In
neurobiology, they have helped researchers determine which neurons are
connected to one another by modeling the structure in their firing patterns
[@schneidman_weak_2006]. Following recent work by @azaele_inferring_2010 and
@fort_statistical_2013, I suggest that ecologists could similarly treat
species as the interacting particles in this modeling framework. Doing so
would allow ecologists to simulate and study the landscape-level consequences
of arbitrary species interaction matrices, even when our observations are not
Gaussian. While ecologists explored some related approaches in the 1980's
[@whittam_species_1981], computational limitations had previously forced
researchers to rely on severe approximations that produced unintelligible
results [e.g. "probabilities" greater than one; @gilpin_factors_1982]. 
Now that it is computationally feasible to fit these models
exactly, the approach has become worth a second look.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. First, I discuss how Markov networks
work and how they can be used to simulate landscape-level data and to predict
the direct and indirect consequences of possible interaction matrices. Then,
using simulated data sets where the "true" ecological structure is known, I
compare this approach with several existing methods for detecting species
interactions. Finally, I discuss opportunities for extending the approach
presented here to larger problems in community ecology.

***Methods***

***Conditional relationships and Markov networks.***
Ecologists are often interested in inferring direct interactions between
species, controlling for the indirect influence of other species. In
statistical terms, this implies that ecologists want to estimate *conditional*
("all-else-equal") relationships, rather than *marginal* ("overall") relationships. 
The most familiar conditional relationship
is the partial correlation, which indicates the portion of the correlation
between two species that remains after controlling for other variables in the
data set [@albrecht_spatial_2001], as opposed to the simple correlation, which
does not control for other variables. The example with the shrubs and trees in
Figure 1 shows how the two correlation measures can have opposite signs, 
and suggests that the partial correlation is more relevant
for drawing inferences about species interactions (e.g. competition). To the
extent that our observations are not multivariate Gaussian (e.g. 
presence-absence data), partial covariances do not describe variables' conditional
relationships exactly, and a more general approach is needed. Markov networks
allow researchers to generalize conditional relationships to non-Gaussian
networks, much as generalized linear models allow researchers to extend
regression to non-Gaussian response variables [@lee_learning_2012].

Markov networks give a probability value for every possible combination of
presences and absences in communities. For example, given a network with
binary outcomes (i.e. 0 for absence and 1 for presence), the relative
probability of observing a given presence-absence vector, $\vec{y}$, is given
by

$$p(\vec{y}; \alpha, \beta) \propto exp(\sum_{i}\alpha_i y_i + \sum_{i\neq j}\beta_{ij}y_i y_j).$$

Here, $\alpha_{i}$ is the amount that the presence of species $i$ contributes
to the log-probability of $\vec{y}$; it directly controls the prevalence of
species $i$. Similarly, $\beta_{ij}$ is the amount that the co-occurrence of
species $i$ and species $j$ contributes to the log-probability, and controls
how often the two species will be found together (Figure 2A, Figure 2B).
$\beta$ thus acts as an analog of the partial covariance, but for non-Gaussian
networks. Because the relative probability of a presence-absence vector
increases when positively-associated species co-occur and decreases when
negatively-associated species co-occur, the model tends to produce assemblages
that have many pairs of positively-associated species and relatively few pairs
of negatively-associated species (exactly as an ecologist might expect).

A major feature of Markov networks is the fact that the conditional
relationships between species can be read directly off the matrix of $\beta$
coefficients [@murphy_machine_2012]. For example, if the coefficient linking
two mutualist species is $+2$, then---all else equal---the odds of observing
either species increase by a factor of $e^2$ when its partner is present
[@murphy_machine_2012]. Of course, if all else is *not* equal (e.g. Figure 1,
where the presence of one competitor is associated with release from another
competitor), then species' marginal association rates can differ from this
expectation. For this reason, it is important to consider how coefficients'
effects propagate through the network, as discussed below.

Estimating the marginal relationships predicted by a Markov network is more
difficult than estimating conditional relationships, because doing so requires
absolute probability estimates. Turning the relative probability given by
Equation 1 into an absolute probability entails scaling by a *partition
function*, $Z(\alpha, \beta)$, which ensures that the probabilities of all
possible assemblages that could be produced by the model sum to one (bottom of
Figure 2B). While the analyses in this paper involve exact computations, this
approach quickly becomes infeasible as the number of species increases: with
$2^N$ possible assemblages of $N$ species the number of bookkeeping operations
required for exact inference quickly spirals exponentially into the billions.
Numerous techniques are available for working with Markov networks that keep
the computations tractable, either through analytic approximations
[@lee_learning_2012] or Monte Carlo sampling [@salakhutdinov_learning_2008],
but these techniques are beyond the scope of this paper.

***Simulations.***
In order to compare different methods for drawing inferences from
observational data, I simulated two sets of landscapes using known
parameters.

The first set of simulated landscapes included the three competing
species shown in Figure 1. For each of 1000 replicates, I generated a
landscape with 100 sites by sampling exactly from a probability distribution
defined by the interaction coefficients in that figure. Each of the methods
described below (a Markov network, two correlation-based methods and a null modeling 
approach) was then evaluated on its ability to correctly infer that all
three species interactions were negative, despite the frequent co-occurrences
of the two shrub species.

I also simulated a second set of landscapes with five, ten, or twenty
potentially-interacting species on landscapes composed of 20, 100, 500, or
2500 observed communities (24 replicate simulations for each combination).
These simulated data sets span the range from small, single-observer data
sets to large collaborative efforts such as the North American Breeding Bird
Survey. As described in Appendix 1, I randomly drew the "true" coefficient
values for each replicate so that most species pairs interacted negligibly, a
few pairs interacted very strongly, and competition was three times more
common than facilitation. I then used Gibbs sampling to randomly generate
landscapes with varying numbers of species and sites via Markov chain Monte
Carlo (Appendix 1). For half of the simulated landscapes, I treated each
species' $\alpha$ coefficient as a constant, as described above. For the other
half, I treated the $\alpha$ coefficients as linear functions of two abiotic
environmental factors that varied from location to location across the
landscape (Appendix 1). The latter set of simulated landscapes provide an
important test of the methods' ability to distinguish co-occurrence patterns
that were generated from pairwise interactions among the observed species from
those that were generated by external forces like abiotic environmental
filtering. This task was made especially difficult because---as with most
analyses of presence-absence data for co-occurrence patterns---the inference
procedure did not have access to any information about the environmental or
spatial variables that helped shape the landscape [cf @connor_checkered_2013;
@blois_framework_2014].


***Inferring $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients from presence-absence data.***
The previous sections involved known values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In most
real cases, however, the true values of these parameters are not known, and
ecologists  will need to estimate them from data. When the number of species
is reasonably small, one can compute exact maximum likelihood estimates for
all of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients by optimizing Equation 1
(Appendix 2).  Doing so allows us to find the unique set of $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ coefficients that would be expected to produce exactly the observed
occurrence frequencies and co-occurrence frequencies. Fully-observed Markov
networks like the ones considered here have unimodal likelihood surfaces
[@murphy_machine_2012], ensuring that this procedure will always converge on
the global maximum.  

For the analyses in this paper, I made a small modification to this maximum
likelihood procedure. Given the large number of parameters associated with
some of the networks to be estimated, I regularized the likelihood using a
logistic prior distribution [@gelman_weakly_2008] with a scale of 1 on the
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ terms. 

The optimization procedures described here and in Appendix 2 are implemented
in the *rosalia* package^[source code available for download from
https://github.com/davharris/rosalia] for the R programming language
[@r_core_team_r_2015].

***Other inference techniques for comparison.***
After fitting Markov networks to the simulated landscapes described above, I
used several other techniques for inferring the sign and strength of marginal
associations between pairs of species.

The first two interaction measures were the simple and partial covariances
between each pair of species' data vectors on the landscape
[@albrecht_spatial_2001]. Because partial covariances are undefined for
landscapes with perfectly-correlated species pairs, I used a regularized
estimate based on ridge regression [@van_wieringen_ridge_2014; i.e. linear
regression with a Gaussian prior]. For these analyses, I set the ridge
parameter to 0.2 divided by the number of sites on the landscape.

The third method, described in @gotelli_empirical_2009, involved simulating
possible landscapes from a null model that retained the row and column sums of
the original matrix [@strong_ecological_1984]. Using the default options in the
Pairs software described in @gotelli_empirical_2009, I simulated  the null
distribution of scaled C-scores (a test statistic describing the number of
*non*-co-occurrences between two species).  The software then calculated a
$Z$-statistic for each species pair using this null distribution. After
multiplying this statistic by $-1$ so that positive values corresponded to
facilitation and negative values corresponded to competition, I used it as
another estimate of species interactions.

***Method evaluation.***
For the first simulated landscape (three species), I kept the evaluation
simple and qualitative: any method that reliably determined that the two shrub
species were negatively associated passed; other methods failed.

For the larger landscapes, I rescaled the four methods' estimates using linear
regression through the origin so that they all had a consistent
interpretation. In each case, I regressed the "true" $\beta$ coefficient for
each species pair against the model's estimate, re-weighting the pairs so that
each landscape contributed equally to the rescaled estimate^[The null model
generated one $Z$-score outlier greater than 1000, which dominated the
regression and squared error analyses. To reduce its influence on these
results, I changed its value to 32.5, which was the value of the next largest
$Z$-score in the null model's results.]. Then, for each combination of species
richness, landscape size, method, and presence/absence of environmental
filtering, I calculated the mean squared error associated with the rescaled
estimate across all 12 replicates. Finally, I calculated an $R^2$ value for
each landscape by comparing this squared error estimate with the squared error
associated with the null hypothesis that all interactions were zero.

***Results***

***Three species.***
As shown in Figure 1, the marginal relationship between the two shrub species
was positive---despite their competition for space at a mechanistic level---
due to indirect effects of the dominant tree species. As a result, the
covariance method falsely reported positive associations 94% of the time
and the randomization-based null model falsely reported such associations 100%
of the  time. The two methods for evaluating conditional relationships (Markov
networks and partial covariances), however, successfully controlled for the
indirect pathway via the tree species and each correctly identified the direct
negative interaction between the shrubs 92% of the time.

***Larger landscapes.***
The Markov network consistently outperformed all of the other techniques that
I evaluated (Figure 3). Of the remaining methods, partial covariances tended
to be most accurate, especially when 100 or more communities had been observed
on the landscape. $Z$-scores from the null model had the least predictive
utility overall, as indicated by $R^2$ values. In general, all the models'
accuracies declined when environmental filters were added, but the declines
were smaller when environmentally-induced correlations were spread out among a
larger number of pairwise interactions.

***Discussion***

The results presented above are very promising, as they show that Markov
networks can recover much of the variation in species' pairwise interaction
strengths from observational data, even when direct interactions are largely
overwhelmed by indirect effects (e.g. Figure 1) or environmental effects
(lower panels of Figure 3). For cases where it is infeasible to fit a Markov
network, these results also indicate that partial covariances---which can be
computed straightforwardly by linear regression---can often provide an
accurate approximation.

Apart from the environmental filters, the simulated landscapes presented here
represent the best-case scenario for these methods.  Future research should
thus examine these models' performance characteristics when the "true"
interaction matrices include guild structure or trophic levels, which could
make the $\beta$ coefficients much more difficult to infer (particularly for
linear approximations like the partial covariance approach;
@loh_structure_2013). On the other hand, ecologists may often have prior 
information about the nature of real species' interaction patterns from 
natural history or ecological experiments, which could substantially reduce
the probability and magnitude of error. The rosalia package has built-in
mechanisms for incorporating this kind of information, if it can be expressed
as a prior probability distribution or a penalty on the likelihood.

Additionally, it is important to note that, while partial correlations and
Markov networks both prevent us from mistaking marginal associations for
conditional ones, they cannot tell us the underlying biological mechanism.
Real species co-occurrence patterns will depend on a number of factors---especially
in taxa that emigrate in response to other species---and the
$\beta$ coefficients in Markov networks have to reduce this to a single
number. Thus, experiments and natural history knowledge will generally be
required to pin down the exact nature of the interaction (e.g. who outcompetes
whom).

Despite these limitations, the results with environmental filtering seem to
indicate that the method can be very robust.  Additionally, the fact that
Markov networks provide a likelihood function to optimize makes them highly
extensible, even when it is inconvenient to compute the likelihood exactly.
For example, the mistnet software package for joint species distribution modeling
[@harris_generating_2015] can fit *approximate* Markov networks to large
species assemblages (>100 species) while simultaneously modeling each species'
response to the abiotic environment with complex, nonlinear functions. This
sort of approach, which combines multiple ecological processes, could help
ecologists to disentangle different factors behind the co-occurrence patterns
we observe in nature. Numerous other extensions are possible: similar networks
can be fit with continuous variables, count data, or both
[@lee_learning_2012]. There are even methods [@whittam_species_1981;
@tjelmeland_markov_1998] that would allow the coefficient linking two species
in an interaction matrix to vary as a function of the abiotic environment or
of third-party species that could tip the balance between facilitation and
exploitation [@bruno_inclusion_2003]. Fully exploring these possibilities will
require more research into the various available approximations to the log-likelihood
and to its gradient, in order to balance efficiency, accuracy, and
the ability to generate confidence limits for statistical inference.

By providing precise quantitative expectations about the results of species
interactions, Markov networks have the potential for addressing long-standing
ecological questions. For example, Markov networks can provide a precise
answer to the question of how competition affects species' overall prevalence,
which was a major flash point for the null model debates in the 1980’s
[@strong_ecological_1984]. From Equation 1, one can derive the expected
prevalence of a species in the absence of biotic influences ($\frac{1}{1 +
e^{-\alpha}}$). Any significant difference between this value and the observed
prevalence can be attributed to the $\beta$ coefficients linking this species
to its facilitators and competitors (cf Figure 2D).

This paper only scratches the surface of what Markov networks can do for
ecology. This family of models---particularly the Ising model for binary
networks---has been extremely well-studied in statistical physics for nearly a
century, and the models' properties, capabilities, and limits are well-understood
in a huge range of applications, from spatial lattices
[@gelfand_modelling_2005] to haphazard neural connections in the retina and
brain [@schneidman_weak_2006] to complex behavioral interactions among human
beings [@lee_statistical_2013]. Modeling species interactions using the same framework
would thus allow ecologists to tap into an enormous set of existing discoveries and
techniques for dealing with indirect effects, stability, and alternative
stable states.

Finally, the null models commonly used by ecologists for drawing inferences
about pairwise species interactions do not seem to distinguish between direct
and indirect interactions any better than simple correlation coefficients.
Null and neutral models can be very useful for clarifying our thinking about the numerical
consequences of species' richness and abundance patterns
[@harris_occupancy_2011; @xiao_strong_2015], but it is less clear whether deviations
from the null hypothesis can clearly implicate specific biological processes like 
competition.

**A.** A small network of three competing species. The tree (top) tends not to
co-occur with either of the two shrub species, as indicated by the strongly
negative coefficient linking them. The two shrub species also compete with one
another, as indicated by their negative coefficient (circled), but this effect
is substantially weaker. **B.** In spite of the competitive interactions
between the two shrub species, their shared tendency to occur in locations
without trees makes their occurrence vectors positively correlated (circled).
**C.** Controlling for the tree species' presence with a conditional method
such as a partial covariance or a Markov network allows us to correctly

***Figure 2.***
**A.** A small Markov network with two species.  The depicted abiotic
environment favors the occurrence of both species ($\alpha >0$), particularly
species 2 ($\alpha_2 > \alpha_1$). The  negative $\beta$ coefficient linking
these two species implies that they co-occur less than expected under
independence.  **B.** Relative probabilities of all four possible presence-absence
combinations for Species 1 and Species 2. The exponent includes
$\alpha_1$ whenever Species 1 is present ($y_1 = 1$), but not when it is
absent ($y_1 = 0$).  Similarly, the exponent includes $\alpha_2$ only when
species $2$ is present ($y_2 = 1$), and $\beta$ only when both are present
($y_1y_2 = 1$). The normalizing constant $Z$, ensures that the four relative
probabilities sum to 1.  In this case, $Z$ is about 18.5.  **C.** Using the
probabilities, we can find the expected frequencies of all possible co-occurrence
 patterns between the two species of interest. **D.** If $\beta$
equaled zero (e.g. if the species no longer competed for the same resources),
then the reduction in competition would allow each species to increase its
occurrence rate and the deficit of co-occurrences would be eliminated.
