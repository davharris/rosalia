#These are the important ones, the amount of resources you want to use.
#Nodes are the number of seperate servers that you want to use. ppn is processors per node.
#Using more than 1 node requires your script to have cross server communication built into it, so for most work we'll
#probably just use single nodes.
#ppn should match the number of threads/cores you setup in your script. Our max for the lab at the moment is 32.

#The amount of memory that your script will require. This can be just a rough guess with some buffer added on.

#The length of time your script will run. again this can be a rought guess with some buffer time added.

#The actual command to run your script like you would from the command line.
